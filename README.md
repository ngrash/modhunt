```
A scrappy thought cast into lines of code,
Born in the frenzy of a weekend’s load.
No polish, no pride in tidy design—
Just passion and haste set everything in line.

Judge not my craft by these ragged drafts,
For the glean of skill lies in other crafts.
Use this as you wish, break or enhance—
This little hack was a moment’s chance.
